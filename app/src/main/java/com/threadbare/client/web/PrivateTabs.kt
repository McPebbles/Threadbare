/**
 * Which browsers will actually open a private tab when another app asks, and —
 * just as importantly — which will not.
 *
 * ## The finding that shapes this file
 *
 * **Chromium refuses third-party incognito launches.** `IntentHandler`'s
 * `isAllowedIncognitoIntent()` limits `EXTRA_OPEN_NEW_INCOGNITO_TAB` to Chrome's
 * own intents and to validated Custom Tabs. That extra is passed around widely
 * as "the way to open an incognito tab", and from an app like this one it does
 * nothing: the link opens in an ordinary tab. Chrome, **Vanadium**, Brave and
 * every other Chromium fork inherit that behaviour.
 *
 * That makes it a trap rather than a fallback. A user who turns on "always open
 * privately" and gets a normal tab is worse off than one who was told the
 * feature is unavailable, because they will browse as though they are protected
 * when they are not. **So this app never sends an intent it cannot expect to be
 * honoured, and never describes a launch as private unless it is.**
 *
 * ## What does work
 *
 * Firefox for Android honours a `private_browsing_mode` extra from third-party
 * apps as of version 112 (Bugzilla 1807531, RESOLVED FIXED). Its forks inherit
 * it. Tor Browser is private by construction. Those are the entries below.
 *
 * ## What was considered and left out
 *
 * An *ephemeral Custom Tab* (`androidx.browser.customtabs.extra.ENABLE_EPHEMERAL_BROWSING`)
 * is open to any app and would cover Chromium. It is not used because the
 * androidx API offers **no way to ask whether the browser supports it** — the
 * documentation says only "if the browser supports it". A browser that ignores
 * the extra renders a Custom Tab that looks exactly like one honouring it, which
 * is precisely the silent-failure mode this file exists to avoid.
 *
 * Free of `android.*` so the table and its rules are checked on the JVM.
